    <h3>Baby Hulk’s First Hello</h3>
    <p>Once upon a time, in the heart of the dense Amazon rainforest, a tiny green creature was born. But this was no ordinary baby—it was Baby Hulk. Yes, the same Hulk who would later grow into a colossal, rage-fueled superhero. But for now, he was just a little guy, blinking up at the world with his oversized eyes.<br><br>  
    The jungle welcomed Baby Hulk with a symphony of chirping birds, rustling leaves, and distant monkey calls. The air smelled of damp earth and adventure. Baby Hulk wiggled his pudgy fingers and kicked his tiny feet, eager to explore.<br><br>  
    <img src="rainforest.jpeg" width="250" height="250" alt="Hulk Being Born in the Rainforest"><br><br>    
    His first encounter was with a curious toucan perched on a branch. The toucan tilted its colorful beak and squawked, “Who are you, little one?”<br><br>      
    Baby Hulk puffed out his chest (well, as much as a baby can) and replied, “Hulk!”<br><br>      
    The toucan cocked its head. “Hulk? That’s an interesting name. Welcome to the jungle, Hulk.”<br><br> 
    <img src="toucan.jpeg" width="250" height="250" alt="Hulk Meeting the Toucan"><br><br>     
    And so, Baby Hulk ventured deeper. He met a slithering snake who hissed, “What brings you here, greenling?”<br><br>      
    "Hulk explore,” Baby Hulk declared, flexing his miniature biceps.<br><br>      
    The snake chuckled. “Explore away, little Hulk. But beware the quicksand and the mischievous monkeys.”<br><br>
    <img src="snake.jpeg" width="250" height="250" alt="Hulk Meeting the Snake"><br><br>
    Baby Hulk nodded solemnly, committing the warnings to memory. He splashed in puddles, tasted raindrops, and even tried to lift a fallen tree branch (it didn’t budge, but he felt strong anyway).<br><br>      
    As the sun dipped low, Baby Hulk stumbled upon a clearing. And there, bathed in golden light, stood a majestic waterfall. Its cascading waters whispered secrets of ancient times.<br><br>
    <img src="waterfall.jpeg" width="250" height="250" alt="Hulk Near a Waterfall"><br><br>      
    Baby Hulk raised his arms to the sky and shouted, “Hello, World!”<br><br>      
    <img src="hello.jpeg" width="250" height="250" alt="Hulk Screaming Hello"><br><br>
    The jungle hushed, as if holding its breath. Even the monkeys paused their mischief.<br><br>      
    And then, from the treetops, a wise old parrot squawked, “Hello, little Hulk! You’ve just spoken the oldest language—the language of wonder.”<br><br>      
    Baby Hulk beamed. “Wonder?”<br><br>      
    “Yes,” said the parrot. “The world is full of marvels waiting for you. Adventure, friendship, and discovery—all wrapped in the magic of ‘hello.’”<br><br> 
    <img src="parrot.jpeg" width="250" height="250" alt="Hulk Talking to a Parrot"><br><br>
    And so, Baby Hulk sat by the waterfall, listening to its ancient song. He vowed to greet every corner of the world with the same enthusiasm—with a resounding “Hello!”<br><br>      
    As the stars blinked into existence, Baby Hulk whispered, “Goodnight, World. Tomorrow, we explore more.”<br><br>      
    And the jungle whispered back, “Goodnight, little Hulk. May your adventures be as boundless as your spirit.”<br><br>      
    And that’s how Baby Hulk learned that sometimes, the greatest strength lies not in smashing things but in saying “hello” to the world.<br><br>      
    And so, dear reader, whether you’re a tiny green Hulk or a regular human, remember to greet the world with wonder. Who knows what adventures await?</p>
